# Simplex B Splines

## General info
This project contains scripts that allow for estimating a simplex B-splines model from data. The theory is taken from the lecture slides of the course AE4320 System Identification of Aerospace Vehicles as part of the Master Control and Simulation on faculty of Aerospace Engineering of Delft University of Technology.
	
## Required packages
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib (only for running the example)

## How to use
In the file 'Example.py' almost all the functions that are available are shown. These consist of estimating a model from data, saving the model, opening a saved model and evaluating the simplex spline at a given set of vertices.
